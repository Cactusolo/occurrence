# Brief information about the featured occurrences:

Create an hbase table which is named by the propery in the pom and should be populated with something like this:

SELECT cell, collect_set(occId)
FROM 
(
  SELECT max(id) as occId, dataset_id, owning_org_id, concat(pmod(cast(latitude AS int),5), ':', pmod(cast(longitude AS int),5)) as cell
  FROM uat_occurrence_hdfs
  WHERE 
    dataset_id IS NOT NULL AND 
    owning_org_id IS NOT NULL AND
    latitude>=-85 AND latitude<=85 AND 
    longitude>=-180 AND longitude<=180 AND 
    geospatial_issue=0 AND 
    kingdom_id IN(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
  GROUP BY 
    dataset_id, 
    owning_org_id, 
    kingdom_id, 
    pmod(cast(latitude AS int),5), 
    pmod(cast(longitude AS int),5) 
) t1
GROUP BY cell;
