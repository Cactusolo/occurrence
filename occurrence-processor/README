Occurrence Processor Service
--------------------------------------
This project listens for OccurrenceFragmentedMessages and then runs the entire processing chain, from
fragment->hbase->verbatim->hbase->interpretation->hbase. It sends messages as it progresses through the processing
chain, ending with OccurrencePersistedMessages. In order to use it you need to specify the following properties in a mvn
profile:

occurrencestore.postalservice.threadcount
occurrencestore.postalservice.username
occurrencestore.postalservice.password
occurrencestore.postalservice.virtualhost
occurrencestore.postalservice.hostname
occurrencestore.postalservice.port
occurrencestore.db.table_name
occurrencestore.db.counter_table_name
occurrencestore.db.max_connection_pool
occurrencestore.db.id_lookup_table_name
occurrencestore.processor.zookeeper.connection_string
