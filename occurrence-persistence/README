Occurrence Persistence Service
--------------------------------------
This project serves as an implementation of the Occurrence Service that reads Occurrence objects from HBase. In order
to use it you need to specify the following properties and make them available to Guice (presumably through a mvn
profile that populates a properties file).

occurrence.db.table_name
occurrence.db.counter_table_name
occurrence.db.id_lookup_table_name
occurrence.db.max_connection_pool
occurrence.db.zookeeper.connection_string
